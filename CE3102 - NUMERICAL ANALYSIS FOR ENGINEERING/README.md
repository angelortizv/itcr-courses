# CE3102 - NUMERICAL ANALYSIS FOR ENGINEERING

### Course Brief

This course introduces the most frequently used numerical methods in engineering. The course covers numerical analysis in the solution of equations, root finding, optimization, numerical interpolation, differentiation and integration, solution of differential equations, and some frequently used topics of linear algebra. Likewise, the course introduces some modern aspects of implementing numerical algorithms for scientific and engineering applications.

The future engineer or computer engineer usually fulfills a fundamental role
such in areas of scientific computing, since their training both in the traditional base of
engineering knowledge, and his training in the area of software and architecture of
computers, allow you to handle complex problem-solving topics by means of
computational.

The course requires dealing with problems from other areas of engineering in order to exercise
technical communication skills with professionals from other areas of engineering.

The course presents computational tools that provide an application perspective of theoretical methods presented in previous courses of the curriculum, particularly physics and mathematics. These tools will be used in more advanced courses as functional blocks of the proposed solutions to engineering problems.
