# CE4101 - SOFTWARE SPECIFICATION AND DESIGN

### Course Brief

In this course the student will learn and put into practice techniques and means for the Compilation and documentation of the software requirements, as well as developing the stages, instruments and systematic techniques related to design, being aware of the importance of these steps, as part fundamental of software engineering, understanding the processes concerning the production of technological solutions.


The methodology of the course also seeks to reinforce certain non-technical skills such as teamwork and creativity, as well as the values of responsibility, respect and tolerance. The development of these skills and values will allow an optimal execution of the different activities individually and in groups.

At the end of the course, the student will be able to capture and validate the requirements of a system, apply analysis and modeling techniques to create a specification of software requirements and, based on this specification, design a software solution using a systematic design process, using current technologies and the knowledge acquired in previous courses to develop systems and apply the fundamental concepts of database design from the Databases course.

This course is of vital importance for the rest of the courses taught in the career, since it develops the skills in the student to be able to carry out an adequate management of the requirements and from this design systems that allow providing solutions to the students. specific challenges of each course.
