# CE5508 - SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE

### Course Brief

This course comprises an introduction to the basic concepts of modeling, designing and creating solutions oriented to emerging systems. It gives the student an overview to be able to select and use programming languages, and more advanced technologies to solve computational problems.

The student is expected to have developed the necessary skills and knowledge in the domain of computer architectures, from predecessor courses such as Computer Architecture I (CE-4301), Digital Design Workshop (CE-3201), Software Specification and Design (CE-4101).

In the same way, this course is based on the knowledge acquired in the database area, from the Databases course (CE-3101). The knowledge acquired in this course will serve as a great contribution to the development of the Computer Engineering Design Project courses (CE-5302) and Final Graduation Project (CE5600)
